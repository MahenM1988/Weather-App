# Weather App

## Description

This app uses your public IP address to fetch a current weather update based on your location, provided you are not using a VPN. 

### Important Notes

- **Local Settings:** To maintain simplicity and efficiency, you are not allowed to set local settings manually. While I acknowledge that this limitation may not be ideal for everyone, streamlining the process ensures a smoother user experience. Customization could certainly enhance functionality, and I appreciate your understanding as I work to balance user needs with app performance.

- **Privacy Assurance:** You need not worry about your IP address being detected. This information is public knowledge and is accessible to any server you interact with online. My app uses this data solely to provide accurate weather updates, and your privacy is important to me.

- **API Integration:** The app relies on an API call to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) to deliver real-time weather information, ensuring you get the most up-to-date forecasts.

Thank you for using my Weather App! I hope you enjoy the convenience it offers.
